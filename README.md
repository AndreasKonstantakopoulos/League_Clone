# League Clone

A 3v3 MOBA for playing with friends: two lanes, a jungle between them, towers, a Nexus, minion waves every 20 seconds, gold, items, and 20 champions with 4 abilities each.

Open this folder with Unity 6 LTS in Unity Hub. Packages resolve on first open; create the URP pipeline asset then (Project Settings > Graphics).

## Playing (solo prototype, M2-M5)

1. In Unity run `Tools > Build Greybox Map` (once; re-run to rebuild). Create the URP asset first if the map is pink.
2. Open `Assets/Scenes/Map.unity` and press Play. Pick a champion.
3. Right-click: move / attack. Q W E R: abilities (aim with the mouse). `+ rank` buttons spend skill points. B: shop while standing at your base.
4. Minions spawn every 20 s per lane. Destroy the outer then inner towers in a lane, then the Nexus.

Content (champions, abilities, items) is plain tables in `Assets/Scripts/Data/Content.cs`.
